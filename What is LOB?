Difference between the provided version and real one?
    Name, description, compnay name, phone number, email.

US verification and Int'l verifications are different objects I'm assuming...
    Verification can happen by ->
        1) Upload a csv file
        2) Form provided on the LOB interface
        3) Via APIs provided that are compatiable with several languages 


NODE API address verification:
// npm install lob 

const Lob = require('lob')('live_555a6d31b28bd4226e5fca4499912ca04bc');

Lob.usVerifications.verify({
  recipient:    '',
  primary_line: '',
  secondary_line: '',
  city: '',
  state: '',
  zip_code: ''
}, function (err, res) {
  console.log(err, res);
});
